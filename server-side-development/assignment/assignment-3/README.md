# Assignment 3: Class Photo Book (3/4)

## Assignment Guidelines

Our task in this assignment is to continue the work in [assignment 1](../assignment-1) and [assignment 2](../assignment-2)
in reuse and optimisation. This is accomplished in a series of steps:

- Create a file `data.php` to store the dummy data array, and include the date of birth of each individual.

- Create a file `function.php` to contain functions to calculate the age of an individual and to calculate the year, 
  month, and day count since a person was born.

- Modify `index.php` to import `data.php` and `function.php`, and create a function for displaying a single card with 
  all necessary parameters and logic to render the information, including the age and how long ago the person was born.

- Modify `detail.php` to import `data.php` and `function.php` and show the age and how long ago the person was born.
