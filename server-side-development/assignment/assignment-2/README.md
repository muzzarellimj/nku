# Assignment 2: Class Photo Book (2/4)

## Assignment Guidelines

Our task in this assignment is to continue the work realised in [assignment 1](../assignment-1) and, instead of an HTML
card and detail page per member, create an HTML template that is populated with PHP on load, both in the index and 
detail pages.

- To `index.php`: create a dummy data array and modify the HTML code to populate data from the array with PHP, and link
  each member card to the detail page with a differentiating factor to enable GET requests.

- To `detail.php`: include the dummy data array from `index.php` and modify the HTML code to populate data from the 
  array with PHP based on the values received from a GET request, and add a link to return to the index.
