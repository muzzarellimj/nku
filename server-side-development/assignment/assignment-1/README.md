# Assignment 1: Class Photo Book (1/4)

## Assignment Guidelines

Our task in this assignment is to create a photo book for our class, which will include an index page of students with
each component linking to detail pages for each of us. To this end, we should install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
and clone [this repository](https://github.com/NKU-ASE/ASE230-assignments-personal-website), and make the following
modifications:

- To `index.html`: add personal information into the **first** card component using PHP echo tags; fix indentation and 
  code issues, should any exist; and rename the file appropriately (.php).

- To `detail.html`: add personal information to the page using PHP echo tags; fix indentation and code issues, should 
  any exist; add a link to go back to the index page; and rename the file as `MICHAEL_MUZZARELLI.php`.
