## Course Guidelines

Server-Side Development, ASE 230-001, is taught in Fall '22 by Dr. Nicholas Caporusso. The only required material is 
[PHP for the Web: Visual Quick Start Guide, 5E](https://www.amazon.com/PHP-Web-Visual-QuickStart-Guide/dp/0134291255).

This course focuses on the server-side component of websites and web applications. We will design and develop software 
that rely on client-server synchronous and asynchronous interaction and on different types of databases to enable user 
authentication, dynamic content creation, and access control.

### Delivery Format

This course is delivered in-person with assignments, quizzes, and supplemental resources made available on Canvas.
