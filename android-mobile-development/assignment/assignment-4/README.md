# Assignment 4: Retrofit

## Assignment Guidelines

This assignment involves adding a detail screen API call to the Retrofit integration completed in 
class, as seen in [this pull request](https://github.com/tiemonl/AndroidClassDemo/pull/3). We will 
be graded on proper architecture patterns, codes standards, naming conventions, and code formatting.
We are required to complete the following:

- complete the Retrofit integration into our ongoing class application
- add another API call for the detail screen to request appropriate data
- update the home screen card view to ingest the API data
- update the detail screen detail view to ingest the API data
- create a new view model to ingest the repository and fetch detail data accordingly

This assignment is worth 40 points and will be graded on overall project structure to this point in 
the semester as well as the additional API call and data ingestion.

## Submission

This assignment should be submitted via a link to a GitHub release with the tag `a4retrofit` and 
**must** be submitted from the generated [GitHub classroom repository](https://github.com/CSC-415/csc-415-class-app-muzzarellimj).
As such, once work is completed in this repository, it should be migrated to that repository prior 
to submission.
