# Homework 4: Make a Plan for Team Project

This is a team effort, but only the team leader submits the deliverables.

## Business Logic

Each team has two options. 

* They can use the `calculator` Flutter app in the reference/project. Students can extend the app to implement advanced calculator features (such as a scientific calculator or unit conversion).
* They can use the `climate` Students can extend the app to add features. 

## Requirements

Each student develops at least two features. 

## Prototype

Use the Flutter apps in the reference/project directory as the prototype. 

## Design

Each team should design the application using a UML diagram.

## Code Review

Each team should meet regularly to discuss their code and remove the code smell.

## Redesigning, Refactoring, and Revising Tests

Students redesign, refactor, and revise tests whenever necessary. Write down all the code smells your team members sensed and how they could remove the code smell through refactoring and applying design patterns. 

## Presentation and Documentation

Make design documents that include all the documents the team makes. Make a manual to explain the features to clients. Make a PPT or PDF slide file for the presentation.

## Chores

- [x] set up a team GitHub repository
- [ ] check team Canvas project pages - team, leader, and member - but probably just a team page
- [ ] create team rules
- [ ] choose other team project tools
- [ ] set up milestone schedule
- [ ] write plans on the Canvas project page
- [ ] start following the above plan

## Deliverables

1. Homework 4 - team leader should submit the grading report.
2. Homework 8 - the individual project - should be submitted by the team leader.
3. Team project should be submitted by the team leader.
