## Course Guidelines

Data Structures and Algorithms, CSC 364-001, is taught in Spring 2022 by Dr. Rasib Khan. The only required material 
is Introduction to Java Programming (10E, 11E, or 12E), Comprehensive Edition, by Y. Daniel Liang. MyProgrammingLab is 
not required.

This course studies concepts of algorithm design and efficiency; analysis and efficient implementation of container 
types such as stacks, queues, hash tables, and search trees; sorting algorithms; and elementary graph algorithms.

### Course Format

This course is delivered in-person with assignments, quizzes, and supplemental resources made available on Canvas. 
Throughout the semester, we will follow a weekly milestone format in which we will complete a series of tasks covering 
a new section of material in notes, supplemental resources, and assignments.
