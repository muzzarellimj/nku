# Homework 4: Make a Plan for Team Project

## Business Logic

We develop the Tetris application using Python / PyGame.

## Requirements

Each team member develops at least three features. For example, they can add sound when the users click a keyboard. Each team member makes requirements for the features.

## Prototype

HW3 requires students to read and understand the prototype code.

## Design

When students successfully finish HW3, they refactor the prototype into an OOP-based application. Meet to decide what OOP design they use and use the design to add features. Make a UML class diagram (if necessary, make an object or sequence diagram) for the design.

## Code Review

Each team should meet regularly to discuss their code and remove the code smell.

## Redesigning, Refactoring, and Revising Tests

Students redesign, refactor, and revise tests whenever necessary. Write down all the code smells your team members sensed and how they could remove the code smell through refactoring and applying design patterns.

## Presentation and Documentation

Make design documents that include all the documents the team makes. Make a manual to explain the features to clients. Make a PPT or PDF slide file for the presentation.

## Chores

2. Check team and individual Canvas project pages
3. Make team rules
4. Choose team project tools for communication and documentation

6. Write the plan on the Canvas project page
7. Start following the above plan

## Submission
