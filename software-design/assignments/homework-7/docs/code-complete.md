## Chapter 33: Personal Character

- **Isn’t Personal Character Off the Topic?** - programming requires strong personal character because it is demanding, unsupervised, and requires continuous self-improvement.
- **Intelligence and Humility** - humble programmers are better programmers because they are more likely to use effective programming practices.
- **Curiosity** - programmers should be curious, learn from successful projects, read other people's code, read books and periodicals, affiliate with other professionals, and make a commitment to professional development.
- **Intellectual Honesty** - programmers should be intellectually honest by admitting mistakes, understanding compiler messages, understanding their programs, providing realistic status reports and schedule estimates, and standing firm on their estimates.
- **Communication and Cooperation** - programmers should write readable code as if they are communicating with another programmer first and the computer second.
- **Creativity and Discipline** - programmers should use conventions and engineering discipline because large-scale projects require them to avoid chaos and focus creativity on the important parts.
- **Laziness** - programmers should be intelligently lazy by avoiding work that doesn't need to be done, quickly doing unpleasant work, or writing tools to automate unpleasant tasks.
- **Characteristics That Don’t Matter As Much As You Might Think** - in software development, persistence, experience, and gonzo programming are often not as valuable as adaptability, continuous learning, and thoughtful effectiveness.
- **Habits** - programmers should develop good habits early because habits determine whether they are good or bad programmers.

## Chapter 34: Software Craftsmanship

- **Conquer Complexity** - reduce the cognitive load on your mind via abstraction, conventions (rules), and discipline.
- **Pick Your Process** - be conscious of quality from the start (requirements) to the finish (deployment) and beyond (maintenance).
- **Write Programs for People First** - code readability is hugely important for comprehensibility, review-ability, error rate, error correction, modifiability, and the consequent development time and quality.
- **Program into Your Language, Not in it** - think of the “why” and “what” before the “how"; use the best programming language for the problem domain.
- **Focus Your Attention with Conventions** - conventions (rules) manage complexity by providing structure where needed so that the ultimate resource (your attention) can be effectively used.
- **Watch for Falling Rocks** - as programming merges art and science, good judgment is vital, including paying attention to warning signs.
- **Program in Terms of the Problem Domain** - works at the highest level of abstraction possible; top-level code should describe the problem being solved.
- **Iterate, Repeatedly, Again and Again** - iterate requirements, design, estimates, code, code tuning (we call this the Agile process).
- **Thou Shalt Render Software and Religion Apart** - don’t be an inflexible zealot, as it precludes curiosity and learning; go beyond having just a hammer in your toolbox; be eclectic and willing to experiment.
