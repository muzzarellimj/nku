# Clean Code

## Chapter 1: Clean Code

- Good code is important because bad code can slow down development and make it difficult to maintain.
- Programmers should take the time to write clean code, even if it means meeting deadlines.
- Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and change.
- There are many different qualities of clean code, but some of the most important are simplicity, expressiveness, and lack of duplication.
- Programmers can develop their ability to write clean code by practicing and learning from other programmers.
- Clean code is obvious, simple, and compelling, making it easy to understand and modify.
- Clean code makes the programming language look like it was made for the problem, not the other way around.
- Programmers should make an effort to keep code clean over time, even if it means making small changes.
