# Test Driven Development

## Chapter 1: Multi-Currency Money

The chapter uses the example of a money class to illustrate how TDD can be used in practice. The authors start by writing a simple test that tests the multiplication of a dollar amount by an integer. They then write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. They continue in this way, writing tests and code until all of the requirements of the money class have been met, allowing the tests to drive the development each step of the way.

## Chapter 2: Degenerate Objects

Below are the key points:

- The TDD cycle involves writing a test, making it run, and then making it right.
- The goal is to get the bar to go green as quickly as possible.
- Clean code that works is the ultimate goal, but it is not always achievable.
- There are three strategies for quickly getting to green: fake it, use obvious implementation, and triangulation.
- The translation of feelings into tests is a common theme of TDD.
