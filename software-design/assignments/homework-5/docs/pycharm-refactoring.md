# Refactoring with PyCharm

Video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kzEbqaT2DY&ab_channel=PyCharmbyJetBrains). I watched this video on Wednesday, November 1, 2023.

1. Python has a refactoring context menu which contains thirteen tools, three of which were discussed in the video: rename, change signature, move, copy, introduce variable, introduce constant, intoduce field, introduce parameter, extract method, extract superclass, inline, pull members up, and push members down.

2. Rename and change signature can be compared to the ["simplifying method calls"](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/techniques/simplifying-method-calls) refactoring techniques; e.g., rename matches [rename method](https://refactoring.guru/rename-method). Introduce variable, introduce constant, intoduce field, introduce parameter, extract method, extract superclass, and inline can all be compared to the corresponding [composing methods](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/techniques) refactoring techniques; e.g., introduce variable matches [extract variable](https://refactoring.guru/extract-variable). Pull members up and push members down can both be compared to the corresponding ["dealing with generalization"](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/techniques/dealing-with-generalization) refactoring techniques; e.g., pull members up matches [pull up field](https://refactoring.guru/pull-up-field), [pull up method](https://refactoring.guru/pull-up-method), and [pull up constructor body](https://refactoring.guru/pull-up-constructor-body).
