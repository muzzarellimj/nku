# Experience with Refactoring

1. Due to working on a large-scale, customer-facing product in a corporate structure, I have experienced a number of code smells:

    - long method
    - large class
    - long parameter list
    - switch statements
    - divergent change
    - shotgun surgery
    - comments (sometimes for code that has been long removed)
    - duplicate code
    - dead code
    - feature envy
    - inappropriate intimacy
    - message chains

2. Both at work and in my personal projects, I have used the following refactoring techniques:

    - extract method
    - extract variable
    - move method
    - move field
    - remove middle man
    - replace type code with state/strategy
    - consolidate conditional expression
    - replace conditional with polymorphism
    - add parameter
    - rename method
    - parameterize method
