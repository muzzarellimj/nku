## Installation

The CLI tools required vary by operating system, as discussed below:

- **Windows**: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and 
  [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71?activetab=pivot:overviewtab), and 
  [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab).
- **macOS**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
- **Linux**: no third-party tools are required, but ensure we are using Ubuntu and know how to use `apt`.

After installing the respective CLI tool, [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/), [MongoDB Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell),
and [DiffMerge](https://www.diffmerge.net/) must be installed. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) must 
also be installed, as well as the Quokka, Live Server, Code Runner, JavaScript (ES6) code snippets, Markdown PDF, 
GitLens, XML, and Markdown all-in-one extensions.

## Preparation

In preparation for upcoming assignments, we need to write data in a few file formats, starting with [Markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/).
To start, create a Markdown document containing the following information for courses taken at NKU: course name, course
number, if the course was attended (T/F), semester attended, and professor. The Markdown document must then be manually 
converted to [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction), [YAML](https://yaml.org/), and
[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
