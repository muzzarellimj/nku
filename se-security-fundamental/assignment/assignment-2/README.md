# Introduction to JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB

Documentation should be created, stored in Notion, and uploaded with the final submission.

## JavaScript and Node.js

Download `javascript-examples.zip` from Canvas and read and understand the JavaScript files. 
Note: [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/) must be installed to read and execute the scripts.

## Node.js

Use `hw2.js` in the reference directory and write code (functions or classes) to pass all the tests within the script. 
No output should be printed if all tests are passed. The functioning code should be copied into the `results` directory.

## MongoDB

Using the JSON file from assignment one, create a MongoDB database and write the following functions to interact with 
that data:

- `upload()` to upload the content of the JSON input file to the database
- `read(name)` to display all course records whose name matches a professor name
- `update(name1, name2)` to replace a professor name with another
- `delete()` to delete the course records of courses that have already been attended

The functioning code should be copied into the `results` directory.
