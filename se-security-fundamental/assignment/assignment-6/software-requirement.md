# Software Requirements

The following examples are written with respect to the checklist application we are building as a final project.

## Authored as Requirement Statements

The initial functionality of the application should include the following:

1. users should be able to keyword search for language used in a checklist item.
2. users should be able to convert a list of checklist items to a PDF.
3. users should be able to tag checklist items with categories to better organize their responsibilities.

## Authored as User Stories

Initial functionality of the application is drawn from the following user stories:

1. As a user with a large number of checklist items, I want to search my items so that I can find related tasks and 
   subtasks of the more complex items.
   
2. As a non-technically-inclined user, I want to download my checklists as a PDF so that I can print them and hang them 
   in my office.

3. As a user with individual checklists for personal, professional, and educational items, I want to tag checklist tasks
   with categories so that I can better organize what needs to be done when I am focusing on my personal, professional,
   or educational tasks.
