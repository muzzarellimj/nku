# Debugging with WebStorm

The [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) debugger is an essential feature in the application, as it allows 
for the local debugging of both source code and unit tests with breakpoints and live editing. 
[This](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2018/01/how-to-debug-with-webstorm/) journal article highlights a number of
features, chief among them are...

- Breakpoints can be added in the edge of the editor between the editor pane itself and the line numbers. These 
  breakpoints mark the points at which execution should pause and wait for further instruction.

- Expressions can be evaluated at any breakpoint via typing the expression out in the debug console or selecting the
  expression and selecting the _Quick Evaluate Expression_ action.
