# Check: Schedule and Progress

Our team utilised [Asana](https://asana.com/) to schedule milestones and deadlines and track our progress throughout
this assignment. The span of the project was divided into two sprints: (1) understanding and planning, and (2) 
implementation and improvement.

## Sprint One: Understanding and Planning

The emphasis of the first sprint was understanding the base application as it was provided, debugging and resolving any 
existing errors, and planning and documenting the features we intended to implement. Our schedule was initially 
designed as such:

| Due Date   | Task                                             | Complete | Comment                                                                                                                                                             |
|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2022-04-01 | Complete and submit feature planning document.   | ✓        |                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2022-04-08 | Complete and submit GitHub integration document. | ✓        |                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2022-04-13 | Finish sprint, hold retrospect meeting.          | ✗        | Due to time restrictions, we were unable to hold a formal meeting, but we did reflect on our planning phase via chat and prepare to enter the implementation phase. |

## Sprint Two: Implementation and Improvement

The emphasis of the second sprint was implementing our features as initially designed and improve upon it as necessary 
and as time allowed. Our schedule was initially designed as such:

| Due Date   | Task                                                  | Complete | Comment                                                                                                                                                                |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2022-04-15 | Hold meeting re: HW6, software design.                | ✗        | HW6 and the lectures on software design did not feel entirely applicable to the scope of our project, so we elected not to hold a meeting on the matter.               |
| 2022-04-22 | Finish implementation phase, hold retrospect meeting. | ✗        | Per Peter's first project estimation rule, we did not estimate enough time for implementation, and thus required one extra day to complete our initial implementation. | 
| 2022-04-25 | Finish testing phase, hold final retrospect meeting.  | ✗        | Due to the delay in exiting the implementation phase, the testing phase also required a deadline extension.                                                            |
| 2022-04-29 | Submit final product, celebrate that it is over.      | ✓        | Initially scheduled for 2022-04-27 but was extended per student request.                                                                                               |

## Conclusion

Despite missing some of our milestones, we successfully adjusted our schedule and met our deadlines. I believe this 
experience has better prepared us all for what I imagine a corporate environment may provide - milestones and deadlines
are bound to be adjusted as management, a client, or both decide that a new deadline must be met or a new feature must
be implemented within the current sprint. Additionally, I believe we all feel a greater appreciation for the rules
discussed throughout this class - they are tools to be utilised in more effective communication, preventing deadline
slippage, simplifying what can become a painful process, and managing the complexities that simply "writing code" can
present.
