# Toy Project

This is a sample GitHub repository (or subdirectory thereof) to practice committing files with Git. I used both the 
Git CLI and WebStorm Git GUI to accomplish this. 

Each directory titled `phase-#-...` represents an iteration of the complete toy project, introducing one new package 
and/or feature per commit. The `complete` directory is the final commit which includes all components of the project
in their final form - for the purpose of the toy project, at least.
