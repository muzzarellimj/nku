# PodScholar Research

This document is meant to house research on convention, methodology, approach, etc. completed in an effort to build
our midterm assignment.

## Approach

### Data Management via JSON Blob

We are going to use four JSON Blobs: [a podcast document](http://jsonblob.com/950251742357110784), which stores 
information related to each podcast published; [a user document](http://jsonblob.com/950253428945469440), which stores 
information related to each registered user; [an author document](http://jsonblob.com/950254564695883776), which stores 
information related to each authenticated author; and [a category document](http://jsonblob.com/951604363324047360), 
which stores the list of categories that uploaded podcasts can be listed as and filtered by. A sample JSON file 
structure has been included 
[here](https://github.com/muzzarellimj/full-stack-application-development/blob/main/assignment/midterm/resources/js/json-structure.js).
