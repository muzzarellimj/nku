## Assignment Guidelines

**Note: this assignment has a hard deadline of 11:59pm on March 16. Because it is a midterm, we do not have the option 
of asking for an extension.**

For the midterm assignment, we will outline the PodScholar application and design the client-side interface. The 
document that was presented by Dr. Sanders in class can be found [here](https://nku.instructure.com/courses/47643/files/6406678?wrap=1).
The document describes several standard features, including authentication (registration and sign-in), a podcast upload
form, and a podcast list view. In addition to these features, we are asked to add the following: author profile (with 
podcast feed), account information (and editing thereof), uploaded podcasts by an author, saved podcasts by a user, 
home feed, category feed, and podcast search.

Specifically, our task for the midterm is complete the following:

- ~~create a project repository on GitHub~~
- ~~create the project documentation (DOCX) in which we document all the features~~
- ~~prototype the interface design using any prototyping tool of our choice ([Figma](https://www.figma.com/), Powerpoint, etc.)~~
- ~~implement the front-end of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the use of Bootstrap; we can also ask 
Dr. Caporusso for access to a commercial template from [here](https://elements.envato.com/web-templates).~~
- ~~the interface must use JavaScript to interact with a JSON-based database (e.g., [JSON Blob](https://jsonblob.com/)) to
demonstrate the features of the application~~
- ~~make the website available on GitHub Pages~~
