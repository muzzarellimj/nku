## Assignment Guidelines

Our task in this assignment is to implement a responsive HTML page and the necessary CSS for a website designed 
according to [this](https://i.imgur.com/vkrBblL.png) wireframe, which shows how the webpage should appear on a large
(desktop) screen. This design maintains the following requirements:
- the given pixel sizes are for the large screen only, but this can change in other resolutions
- the footer must be fixed on a large screen, but this can change in other resolutions
- the actual page must contain at least 12 items arranged in a 3x4 matrix on a larger screen
- the filter menu must be sticky
- all buttons (besides the form buttons) must be links
- Bootstrap **cannot** be used

This is a group assignment, but we can work individually or as a team. If we work as a team (and we plan to), we all 
need to submit our own code, even if it is all identical.

## Rubric

This assignment is graded positively on the following elements:
- use the block-element-modifier structure: 2 points
- use at least three features of CSS preprocessors (e.g., loops, mixins, extend, etc.): 3 points
- make use of media queries and have breakpoints for small (mobile) and large (desktop) displays: 2 points
- use the flexbox responsive layout system ([example](https://youtu.be/DszpfHrY3bk) and [example](https://youtu.be/0l7VRxPzwzA)): 2 points
- use semantic HTML tags ([example](https://youtu.be/j5ZK_0jIxTI)): 1 point
- use a custom font family ([example](https://youtu.be/UnOto9a_X8Y)): 1 point
- all links must have at least four states (e.g., default, visited, hover, active): 1 point
- the title of each item can be up to two lines of text, which should not disrupt the alignment of the buttons: 1 point

It is also graded negatively on the following elements:
- use of inline styles: -2 points
- use of tables for creating the layout: -153 points

## Submission

We must all (**individually**) submit a ZIP file containing the following files:
- the pre-compiled version of the CSS
- the compiled version of the CSS
- an HTML page with the content necessary to demonstrate the CSS
- three screenshots of the website showing different configurations
- a text file listing the members of our group, if any
